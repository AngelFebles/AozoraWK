In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a \u003ckanji\u003eritual\u003c/kanji\u003e first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish ceremony.\r\n\r\nThis kanji also means \u003ckanji\u003eequation\u003c/kanji\u003e for some reason too. Just think of a ceremony that involves doing math and coming up with equations. How strange would that be?

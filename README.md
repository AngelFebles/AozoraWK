# AozoraWK

A script that scrapes all of the books on Aozora Bunko (kind of like a Japanese Project Gutenberg, https://www.aozora.gr.jp/) and lists them by what WaniKani level one would have to be at to read 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% of the unique kanji. It's pretty janky and has a lot of hardcoded paths, so if you want to use it yourself you'll have to go in and edit all of that - I really just put it up here because I wanted to store the results somewhere for people to use.

If you're just here for the list, you want the file called Aozora_By_Unique_WK_Kanji.tsv. Enjoy!
